/*
 * Note: The @phosphor-icons/react types are patched via pnpm patch
 * at /patches/@phosphor-icons__react@2.1.10.patch
 *
 * This is needed due to a React 19 + TypeScript 5.9 compatibility issue.
 * The library's IconProps extends ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"svg"> which
 * should include className, but the type inheritance chain is not
 * correctly resolved. The patch explicitly adds commonly used SVG props
 * (className, style, width, height, etc.) to IconProps.
 *
 * TODO: Remove the patch when the library updates for React 19 compatibility.
